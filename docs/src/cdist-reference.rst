Variable, path and type reference for cdist

Paths
-----
$HOME/.cdist
    The standard cdist configuration directory relative to your home directory.
    This is usually the place you want to store your site specific configuration.

cdist/inventory/
    The distribution inventory directory.
    This path is relative to cdist installation directory.

confdir
    Cdist will use all available configuration directories and create
    a temporary confdir containing links to the real configuration directories.
    This way it is possible to merge configuration directories.
    By default it consists of everything in $HOME/.cdist and cdist/conf/.
    For more details see cdist(1).

confdir/files/
    Cdist does not care about this directory besides providing access to it.
    It is thought to be a general file storage area.

confdir/manifest/init
    This is the central entry point.
    It is an executable (+x bit set) shell script that can use
    values from the explorers to decide which configuration to create
    for the specified target host.
    Its intent is to used to define mapping from configurations to hosts.

confdir/manifest/*
    All other files in this directory are not directly used by cdist, but you
    can separate configuration mappings, if you have a lot of code in the
    conf/manifest/init file. This may also be helpful to have different admins
    maintain different groups of hosts.

confdir/explorer/<name>
    Contains explorers to be run on the target hosts, see `cdist explorer <cdist-explorer.html>`_.

confdir/type/
    Contains all available types, which are used to provide
    some kind of functionality. See `cdist type <cdist-type.html>`_.

confdir/type/<name>/
    Home of the type <name>.
    This directory is referenced by the variable __type (see below).

confdir/type/<name>/man.rst
    Manpage in reStructuredText format (required for inclusion into upstream).

confdir/type/<name>/manifest
    Used to generate additional objects from a type.

confdir/type/<name>/gencode-local
    Used to generate code to be executed on the source host.

confdir/type/<name>/gencode-remote
    Used to generate code to be executed on the target host.

confdir/type/<name>/parameter/required
    Parameters required by type, \n separated list.

confdir/type/<name>/parameter/optional
    Parameters optionally accepted by type, \n separated list.

confdir/type/<name>/parameter/default/*
    Default values for optional parameters.
    Assuming an optional parameter name of 'foo', it's default value would
    be read from the file confdir/type/<name>/parameter/default/foo.

confdir/type/<name>/parameter/boolean
    Boolean parameters accepted by type, \n separated list.

confdir/type/<name>/explorer
    Location of the type specific explorers.
    This directory is referenced by the variable __type_explorer (see below).
    See `cdist explorer <cdist-explorer.html>`_.

confdir/type/<name>/files
    This directory is reserved for user data and will not be used
    by cdist at any time. It can be used for storing supplementary
    files (like scripts to act as a template or configuration files).

out/
    This directory contains output of cdist and is usually located
    in a temporary directory and thus will be removed after the run.
    This directory is referenced by the variable __global (see below).

out/explorer
    Output of general explorers.

out/object
    Objects created for the host.

out/object/<object>
    Contains all object specific information.
    This directory is referenced by the variable __object (see below).

out/object/<object>/explorers
    Output of type specific explorers, per object.


Objects
-------
For object to object communication and tests, the following paths are
usable within a object directory:

files
    This directory is reserved for user data and will not be used
    by cdist at any time. It can be used freely by the type
    (for instance to store template results).
changed
    This empty file exists in an object directory, if the object has
    code to be executed (either remote or local).
stdin
    This file exists and contains data, if data was provided on stdin
    when the type was called.

    If set cdist will set this log level in
    accordance with configuration rules. If cdist invokation is used
    in types then nested cdist will honor this specified log level if
    not specified otherwise while invoking it.

CDIST_PATH
    Colon delimited list of config directories.

CDIST_LOCAL_SHELL
    Use this shell locally instead of /bin/sh to execute scripts.

CDIST_REMOTE_SHELL
    Use this shell remotely instead of /bin/sh to execute scripts.

CDIST_OVERRIDE
    Allow overwriting type parameters (see `cdist manifest <cdist-manifest.html>`_).

CDIST_ORDER_DEPENDENCY
    Create dependencies based on the execution order (see  `cdist manifest <cdist-manifest.html>`_).
    Note that in version 6.2.0 semantic of this processing mode is finally fixed and well defined.

CDIST_REMOTE_EXEC
    Use this command for remote execution (should behave like ssh).

CDIST_REMOTE_COPY
    Use this command for remote copy (should behave like scp).

CDIST_INVENTORY_DIR
    Use this directory as inventory directory.

CDIST_COLORED_OUTPUT
    Colorize cdist's output. If enabled, cdist will use different colors for
    different log levels.
